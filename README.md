Diff and patch python data structures.

This library was designed not only to provide useful visual information about the differences between your data structures, but also to provide a structured Diff object to allow you to use diffs programatically. The library function *patch* is an example of this.

The following data structures are currently supported.
* list
* tuple
* str
* set 
* dict
* namedtuple
* OrderedDict

Arbitrary nesting of these structures is also handled.
